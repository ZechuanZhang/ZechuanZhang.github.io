I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at SISSA in Italy. My research interests include Nonlinear wave equations, solitons and integrable systems, inverse scattering transform, spectral theory of differential operators and long-time asymptotics.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tamara Grava](https://people.sissa.it/~grava/) from SISSA/University of Bristol.    

You can find my CV here: [Z. Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](/files/CV-Zechuan_Zhang.pdf).
