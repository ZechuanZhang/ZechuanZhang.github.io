I'm now a visiting assistant professor at SUNY at Buffalo. My research interests include Nonlinear wave equations, solitons and integrable systems, inverse scattering transform, spectral theory of differential operators and long-time asymptotics.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gino Biondini](https://www.nsm.buffalo.edu/~biondini/) from SUNY Buffalo. 

You can find my CV here: [Z. Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV-ZechuanZhang.pdf).
